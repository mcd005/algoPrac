/*
An emulation of the list comprehension method used in my python solution

Starting with the a queue that just has the root in it
Use n to keep track of all the nodes at that level
Iterate through all the nodes at their level, adding their children to the next q
If the node doesn't have children you know it's a leaf, so you add its value to sum
You only return this value of sum, however, when you none of the leaves at a level have children
	(i.e. they are the deepest leaves)
Hence the deepest leaves sum is returned

Time complexity 	O(n)
Space complexity	O(log n)
