#Max number of distinct intengers that can be encountered is equal to the size of the input array
#Therefore we create a boolean array (result) to mark which  positive integer has been encountered
#After walking through the input array and marking the corresponding positive integers in the result array
#we walk through the result array and the first False encountered is the smallest positive integer that does not occur
#If there are no False values in result then the smallest positiive integer not to occur must be one greater than the max in False

#Time Complexity    O(N)
#Space Complexity   O(N)

        #Equally if an int encountered is greater than  N its value is also irrelevant because "smallest" means result is bounded by N
