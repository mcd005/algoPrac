My solutions to Leetcode, Codility and HackerRank algorithmic problems.

For my benefit, the solutions have been sorted into different categories of problems.

Each solution should have in its comments:

- A link to the problem
- An explanation of the algorithm I implemented
- Analysis of time and space complexity of the algorithm

Often solutions will contain multiple versions/iterations as I considered more optimal approaches.

Not all solutions are commented as fully as I outline above but typically Googling the name I've given the function will bring up the problem, and seeing the description should make my approach more understandable. Hope this is helpful!
