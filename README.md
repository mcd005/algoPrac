# algoPrac
My solutions to Leetcode, Codility and HackerRank algorithmic problems.

For my benefit the solutions have been sorted into different categories of problems.

Each solution should have in it's comments:
  
* A link to the problem
* An explanation of the alogrithm I implemented
* Analysis of time and space complexity of the algorithm
  
Often solutions will contain multiple versions/iterations as I considered more optimal approaches.

Not all solutions are commented as fully as I outline above but typically Googling the name I've given the algo will bring up the problem, and seeing the description should make my approach more understandable. Hope this is helpful!
