# Sum all the ones in the array
# Then walk through the array
    #When a 1 is encountered decremet the sum
    #When zero is encountered add the sum to the result
    #Check each iteration if result exceeds max cars
# Return result at the end of the loop

# Time complexity:   O(N)
# Space complexity:  O(1)

#NB: Considered usign a suffix sum method where number of remianing westobound cars for a given index would be stored at the index of a corresponding array, however this would require O(N) space
